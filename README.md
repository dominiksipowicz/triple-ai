- Defining a shortcut in settings to open three synchronized inputs.
- Opening three tabs or iframes targeting Google Gemini, ChatGPT and Grog.
- Synchronizing text input across all three chat inputs in real-time with the option to disable the synchronization for follow up messages.
- Submitting the prompt to all three AI chats simultaneously upon hitting enter (unless synchronization is disabled)
