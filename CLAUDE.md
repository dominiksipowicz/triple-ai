This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Multi-AI Chat Synchronizer - a browser plugin or standalone HTML page that synchronizes text input across three AI chat interfaces (Gemini, ChatGPT, Grok) and submits prompts simultaneously.

## Architecture

The project can be implemented as either:

1. **Chrome Extension**: Uses manifest.json for permissions and keyboard shortcuts
2. **Standalone HTML Page**: deployed as a vercel app (or a simple html page)
